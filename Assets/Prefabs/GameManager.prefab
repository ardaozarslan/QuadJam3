  playerJumpNegativeTexts:
  - Why should I?
  - I don't think there is anything above or below...
  - There is no point of doing that...
  - No, I won't.
  playerJumpPositiveTexts:
  - I wonder what happened to the <sprite=0> here...
  - Why would they jump off the platform?
  - It was the first rule not to jump...
  - Because, otherwise everything would break apart.
  - Maybe... But maybe, it is meant to be broken?
  - 'YES!!!                       '
  - I will jump off the platform and see what happens!
  narratorErrorTexts:
  - That...
  - That really shouldn't have happened...
  - System rebooting...
